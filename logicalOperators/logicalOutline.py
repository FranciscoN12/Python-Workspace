#EX) Make two boolean variables. Put them on either side of the and operator.
#Store this expression in a variable named a. Print the variable.
#from builtins import False
one = True
two = False
a = one and two 
print(a)

#1) Make two boolean variables. Put them on either side of the and operator.
#Store this expression in a variable named a. Print the variable.

a = 2 == 4 and 5 == 5
print(a)


#2) Make two boolean variables. Put them on either side of the or operator.
#Store this expression in a variable named b. Print the variable.

b = 2 < 3 or 5 < 10
print(b)

#3) Make one boolean variable. Put the variable after the not. Store this 
#expression in a variable named c. Print the variable.

c = not 4 == 5
print(c)

#4) Make a logical expression with one of the common SYNTAX errors.

p = 55 == 55 100 == 100 not 
print(p)
