This outline will help solidify concepts from the Comparison Operators lesson.
Fill in this outline as the instructor goes through the lesson.
'''

#1) Make two string variables. Compare them using the == operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.
"apple" == "apple"
#true
r = "apple" == "apple"
print(r)

#2) Make two int variables. Compare them using the == operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.
4 == 4
#true
k = 4==4
print(k)

#3) Make two int variables. Compare them using the > operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.
3 > 2
#true
v = 3 > 2
print(v)

#4) Make two int variables. Compare them using the < operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.
2 < 3
#true
y = 2 < 3
print(y)
#5) Make two int variables. Compare them using the >= operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.
4 >= 3
#true
x = 4 >=3
print(x)
#6) Make two int variables. Compare them using the <= operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.
3 <= 4
#true
v = 3 <= 4
print(v)

#7) Make a comparison with any operator, with one of the common SYNTAX errors.

 >= 4
